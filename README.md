# Based Randomness

BasedRandomness is a general-purpose random number generation (RNG) system designed for on-chain applications. It generates unpredictable and verifiable random numbers without depending on off-chain oracles, ensuring greater security and decentralization. With BasedRandomness, builders can now create RNG solutions for free, empowering on-chain games, decision-making processes, and a wide variety of other use casesâ€”all without the need for centralized RNG systems.

## Features

- On-chain Random Number Generation
- Unpredictability
- Multi Number Generation
- General Purposes Design

## How is it work

To achieve truly fair and unpredictable randomness, the process involves two key steps:

1. To request random numbers:
- a. Prepare an array of maxNumbers, where each maxNumber corresponds to one Request ID for a random number. The upper bound for each random number is 2**120 (VERY BIG).
- b. OPTIONAL: For more unpredictability, generate an initialCumulativeHash (can be any unique bytes32 value), or you can just use 0.
- c. Call prepareRandomNumbers() with these parameters
- d. Implement a custom logic to store the returned requestIds in bytes32.

2. To generate random numbers:
- a. Wait for at least 4 blocks to pass
- b. Call generateRandomNumbers() with the stored requestIds (bytes32) to retrieve your random numbers. You can also request the numbers separately, without being required to follow the same logic as in step 1.
